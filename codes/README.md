# Codes

This folder contains the codes used to benchmark our implementation, as well as the script for the reference model. Details on the poro-elasto-plastic code are detailed on the cryer_test.ipynb notebook. The main outline of the code is represented in Figure 1 through a diagram.

<figcaption align = "center"><b> Figure 1: Pseudocode of poro-elasto-plastic implementation. FEniCS allows the user to select from a wide variety which finite elements, test and trial functions to use. In our implementation, we use a second and first-order continuous Lagrange element for the solid displacement and the fluid pressure, respectively. Meshes can be either created directly on FEniCS or imported from a mesh generator like Gmsh. System assembly is done automatically by FEniCS when inputting the residual form, the tangent operator, and the boundary conditions. von Misesâ€™ correction mapping was implemented manually using FEniCS objects.</b></figcaption>
